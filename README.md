This **Spring Boot CRUD Application** is a RESTful web service that supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data entities. Built using Spring Boot, this application connects to a relational database and exposes REST APIs to perform database operations. Ideal for learning, testing, or as a starting point for more complex applications.

## Features

- **Validation**: Built-in validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error responses for a consistent API experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or higher**
